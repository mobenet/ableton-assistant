{"input":"How do I quantize audio in Ableton?","reference":"Select the audio clip; Cmd/Ctrl+A; Cmd/Ctrl+U to quantize; Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+U to open quantize settings.","k":5}
{"input":"What is warping in Ableton?","reference":"Warping in Ableton is the process of time-stretching and manipulating audio clips to match a project's tempo, synchronize different audio samples, and create creative rhythmic or sound design effects without changing the original pitch. It allows producers to elasticize audio, rearrange notes, and integrate loops of varying speeds into a unified tempo, offering control for beatmatching, remixing, and sound manipulation","k":5}
{"input":"How to set project tempo from clip?","reference":"To set the project tempo from a clip in Ableton Live, you should activate the tempo clip feature, then select the desired clip, and finally toggle the Master button in the clip's details panel to make that clip control the project tempo. The clip needs to be a Tempo Automation clip for this to work. You can create this by disabling warping, making sure the clip plays at its original speed, and then using the Tap Tempo button to match it to the new tempo.","k":5}
{"input":"What are the differences between Beats, Tones, Texture, Repitch and Complex warp modes in Ableton?","reference":"Ableton's warp modes are time-stretching algorithms designed for different audio material: Beats Mode preserves transients for rhythmic material, Tones Mode maintains pitch for melodic sounds, Texture Mode is for complex, non-pitched sounds, Repitch Mode connects time and pitch (speeding up slows down the pitch), and Complex/Complex Pro Modes are best for full tracks by preserving both rhythmic and tonal qualities, with Complex Pro offering more control over formant and envelope","k":5}
{"input":"How do Follow Actions work for clip launching in Session View in Ableton?","reference":"Ableton Follow Actions automate clip and scene launching in Session View, defining what happens next after a clip or scene plays. You activate them by clicking a button in the Clip Launch settings or by pressing Shift+Enter on selected clips. You can choose one of two actions (A and B), set the probability for each using the Chance controls, and specify when the action occurs with the Follow Action Time setting (in bars, beats, or 16th notes). Follow Actions create ordered or randomized sequences of clips, automating live performances or generating new musical ideas.","k":5}
{"input":"Where do I change buffer size and reduce latency?","reference":"To reduce latency in Ableton Live, open Live's Preferences (Cmd/Ctrl + ,), go to the Audio tab, and select a smaller Buffer Size (e.g., 128, 64) for lower latency. However, this increases CPU load. For Windows users, ensure you are using the ASIO driver for your audio interface. You can also enable \"Reduced Latency When Monitoring\" in the Options menu to bypass latency on your master track during recording.","k":5}
{"input":"How to export a mixdown for Spotify (sample rate/bit depth/dither)?","reference":"For exporting a Spotify-ready mixdown in Ableton, set the format to WAV or AIFF, the Sample Rate to 44.1 kHz, and the Bit Depth to 16-bit. Dithering should be enabled if your project's bit depth is higher than 16-bit, using a Triangle dither option, but if you are working at 16-bit throughout, you may not need to apply it.","k":5}
{"input":"How do I consolidate multiple audio clips into one in Ableton?","reference":"To consolidate multiple audio clips into one in Ableton Live, select the desired clips in the Arrangement View and press Command + J (macOS) or Control + J (Windows). This shortcut creates a new audio file from your selection, joining all the clips into a single, continuous audio clip with a single filename.","k":5}
