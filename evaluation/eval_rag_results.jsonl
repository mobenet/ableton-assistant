{"question": "What is warping in Ableton?", "answer": "Warping in Ableton is a unique function that allows you to time-stretch audio, enabling any sample to play in sync with your chosen tempo. This feature is fundamental to Ableton Live, often referred to as time-stretching. Ableton provides various warping algorithms to customize how audio is manipulated, allowing for flexibility in adjusting the timing and pitch of samples.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlsRVC72hx4&t=0s\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcC6nq7h9Ps&t=840s\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-NdjhwWWTo&t=270s", "reference": "Warping in Ableton is the process of time-stretching and manipulating audio clips to match a project's tempo, synchronize different audio samples, and create creative rhythmic or sound design effects without changing the original pitch.

{"question": "How to set project tempo from clip?", "answer": "To set the project tempo from a clip in Ableton Live, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Select the Clip**: Ensure the clip you want to use as a tempo leader is selected.\n2. **Set as Tempo Leader**: In the Clip View, make sure the clip is set as a tempo leader. This can be done by enabling the Leader/Follower switch to Leader.\n3. **Tap Tempo**: Use the Tap Tempo button in the Control Bar to match the tempo of the clip to the project tempo. You can tap in the desired tempo, and it will adjust accordingly.\n4. **Re-enable Warping**: After setting the tempo, re-enable warping for the clip and use the \"Warp From Here (Start At â€¦)\" command to align the clip with the new tempo.\n\nRemember, only one clip can determine the tempo at a time, and if multiple clips are leaders, the bottom-most clip will take precedence.\n\nSources:\n- [Ableton Live Manual - Audio Clips: Tempo and Warping](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/) \n- [YouTube Video on Setting Tempo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQa0UclLItI&t=120s)", "reference": "To set the project tempo from a clip in Ableton Live, you should activate the tempo clip feature, then select the desired clip, and finally toggle the Master button in the clip's details panel to make that clip control the project tempo.

{"question": "What are the differences between Beats, Tones, Texture, Repitch and Complex warp modes in Ableton?", "answer": "In Ableton, the differences between the warp modes are as follows:\n\n1. **Beats**: Designed for rhythmic content, it works well with percussive samples.\n2. **Tones**: Best suited for tonal material, such as vocals or melodic instruments.\n3. **Texture**: Ideal for complex soundscapes like pads or field recordings, focusing on maintaining the texture of the audio.\n4. **Re-Pitch**: Changes the pitch of the audio along with the tempo, similar to how a vinyl record would behave when played at different speeds.\n5. **Complex**: Handles mixed audio files better, especially when dealing with various types of sound material, but is more CPU intensive.\n\nComplex modes may sound better but are not neutral at the original tempo. \n\nSources:\n- [Ableton Live Manual](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/audio-fact-sheet/) \n- [YouTube: Elena Does Audio Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgPF78hMEVw&t=0s)\n- [YouTube: Warp Modes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw1bRwrN-s&t=810s)", "reference": "Ableton's warp modes are time-stretching algorithms designed for different audio material: Beats Mode preserves transients for rhythmic material, Tones Mode maintains pitch for melodic sounds, Texture Mode is for complex, non-pitched sounds, Repitch Mode connects time and pitch (speeding up slows down the pitch), and Complex/Complex Pro Modes are best for full tracks by preserving both rhythmic and tonal qualities, with Complex Pro offering more control over formant and envelope", "correctness": {"verdict": "PARTIAL", "score": 0.7, "justification": "The assistant's answer correctly identifies the purpose of each warp mode but lacks some detail and precision compared to the gold reference.

{"question": "How do Follow Actions work for clip launching in Session View in Ableton?", "answer": "Follow Actions in Ableton Live allow you to automate the launching of clips in Session View based on specified conditions. Each clip can be assigned Follow Actions with defined probabilities and timing. For example, you can set a Follow Action to \"Play Again\" with an 80% chance and \"No Action\" with a 20% chance, meaning the clip is likely to repeat after its duration (e.g., one bar). \n\nYou can create a Follow Action group by splitting a clip into non-looping and looping parts and then dragging them into the Session View. Follow Actions can also be globally enabled, allowing them to function alongside scene Follow Actions, although scene actions take precedence when triggered.\n\nAdditionally, Follow Actions can trigger other clips in the group, allowing for varied playback and creative transitions. They can be paired with clip envelopes and warping to create dynamic variations in your music.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/launching-clips/ (Timestamp: Not specified)", "reference": "Ableton Follow Actions automate clip and scene launching in Session View, defining what happens next after a clip or scene plays.
